# Tooth
java connection to server using http url connection
This utility class for the moment accepts the following:
1. Methods GET and POST, and GET being a default method;
2. Parameter data as HashMap<String, String>

It runs on a separate thread and has a connection listener that listens for a response or an error.

It does not depend on a third party library.
